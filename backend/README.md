# Identity Backend

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using an
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org), you can easily generate a server stub.

To run the server, please execute the following:

```
mvn clean package jetty:run
```

You can then view the OpenAPI v2 specification here:

```
http://localhost:8080/v1/swagger.json
```

Note that if you have configured the `host` to be something other than localhost, the calls through
swagger-ui will be directed to that host and not localhost!

Use a simple call to the API:
```
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/accounts/123
{"code":4,"type":"ok","message":"magic!"}
```
